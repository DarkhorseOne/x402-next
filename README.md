## Compatibility and security

This adapter now requires patched Next.js releases that address CVE-2025-66478 in the React Server Components protocol. Use `next@>=15.0.5 <16` or `next@>=16.0.7 <17` (or the canaries `15.6.0-canary.58` / `16.1.0-canary.12`). There is no workaround—upgrade before integrating.
